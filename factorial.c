  Project Idea: *WebApp* TradeZella but Free,  (goal is to get a whole lotta users not 2 customers)
  
  Phases of development to follow https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-development-life-cycle/
  Use the Weighted scoring for the features, for example, since we want to track the user's trades
  the highest weighted features/non-negotiables would be of course showing the user's trades neatly and 
  letting them type AND showing stats/trends in their behavior. Those 3 are necessary
  (trade's info being type of contract, time spent in the trade, profit, etc.)

//Luis Chavez, 6119616

2.3.24 ez will finish in this last fateful hour
2.4.24 found out the zybooks is just a single one and finish the CTS work
2.5.24 zybook 3 legit


2.6.24 - more exam info
0.Round robin and those type of scheduling questions so just do ZyBooks, avg turn around times - only gotta provide the 
final equation cuz we dont need calculators ------fcfs is not on exam, but the zybooks 3 stuff will b there too (ONLY DRAWIN GANTT CHART) for those---------
1.Alrdy noted above, but test has definitions to be matched by o.s. vocab
2.Privelged instructions - review them to answer comprehendsion/scenario questions (writtten)
3.Multiple choice questions - Processes, threads, kernel, scheduling algos, diff processes states(the ready->suspended bs),
parallelism, no c programming being written BUT there will be a c program with fork system call to be questioned upon. 
Understanding that the child is a copy of the parent.
Real time scheduling algo as well.
4.no calculation on waiting time and such

SJF canvas example, Non-preemptive
Turn around time = compltion time - arrival time 
when doing the gant chart, its always arrival time = 0 first and then, 
ordered by the shortest total cpu time 

RoundRobin scheduling mistake: not keeping track of the ready queue.


2/6/24 - one of the db class, its all zybooks

zybooks 3.2.4 sjf example refresh

PROGRMNG ASSIGNMNT 2 FOR OS
User inputs the # of processes along with burst time & arrival time for each process.
in addition to the desired scheduling algorithm.  this all comes from a txt file so the 
program will read that file.

file descriptor, so since we want to access stuff from this file theres the concept of 
the file descriptor and so the 'FILE *file' makes a pointer to the file and then file
funcs that start with f like f gets, file = fopen(argv[1], "r") gere ra means read also
we open the file, then we scan the file with fscan(file, %d, num_process)
when done gotta put fclose(file)


process arrvl time  total cpu time/burst time?(is it same)
p1      0            6 
p2      1            1
p3      2            4

Round Robin algo, 1.we got a queue 2.priority is based on position of that queue 
3.this highest priority process then can run for Q time units(time quantum), q ends
& the process is moved to the end of the queue.
ex:
process arrvl-time  total cpu time/burst time?(is it same)
p1      n/a            4 
p2      n/a            4
p3      n/a            2

so the q is 1 here there will be blocks on the gant chart only of size 1 until it meets
the total cpu time

-Requirements for Critical-Section Solutions
1. Mutual Exclusion. If process Pi is executing in its critical section (CS), then no other process can execute in its CS.
2. Progress. If no process is executing in its CS and there exist some processes that wish to enter their CS, then the selection of the process that will enter the CS next cannot be postponed indefinitely.
3. Bounded Waiting. There exist a bound on the number of times that other processes are allowed to enter their CS after a process has made a request to enter its CS and before that request is granted.

-take resources away from processes
(starvation[thread cant get acess to resources] --> could happen if you pick the same processes)

No pre emption - a condition that ensures that resources, once allocated, cannot be forcibly taken away from a process. 

can use semaphores, mutex locks, monitors, etc for solution (canvas only says semaphores)

-Practice Exam 2 Problem 2
the 1 asking the pros & cons of the 3 diff ways O.S. handles deadlocks, 
1.Deadlock prevention 2.Deadlock avoidance 3.Deadlock detection 

3.(Detection algo, safe sequences & sees the processes are stuck and the detection algo is run -> we recover from this
by terminating the R's or rollback to safe state OR preempt resources / take em away)

why O.S. ignore deadlocks?
-because its cheaper for the system, rely on the developers as its a rare problem, cheaper as in you dont have to run bankers algo
detection algo.

- for bankers: after max - need, less-than intial checks so it should not exceed the need, 
- SPAM this one https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/FIUCOP4610BenAhmedSpring2024/chapter/5/section/3

-for CS problem with lock set to TRUE #1 is not possible as it would have to be 2 difff Processors holding true for lock

-pthreads and multithreaded applications (probably multiple choice)

--exam will not have paging
--exam will not have next fit
--exam will not have one similar to question 4, a ready implementation will be given to argue whether it is a critical section solution
prove mutual exclusion.
 ex answer:'this is not a cs solution bc at least 1 condnition does not hold...'



Parts left to study,
#1. bankers algo
#2. (FINISH 2ND HALF OF DEADLOCK CONCEPTS) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the 3 different ways an OS can use to handle deadlocks.
#3. (S.O.S.) Problem 3 & 4 of practice, 3 is CS problem,
--------4 is more implementing threads [most important one]----------(turn and flag, petersons solution(polite solution), )



-we define main memory as the bridge between the disk and the cpu, the cpu CANT acess the disk directly
main memory comes in the bad part is its volatile memory and smaller size but faster retrieval, cpu keeps all
temp instructrions it needs for the current task here

-Memory Management Unit(MMU) translates logical addys to physical addys
-compaction: shift all of the used partitions to one side and ur left with bigger empty hole to put the new processes or requests

-Same page table / logic/physical address mapping as the one from comp arch-
computing # of pages 

-givens: page size of 512 words(or 2^9 bits), address space  w/ an adress size of 16 bits

how many bits do i need to adress these 512 words
16 - 9 bits is 7 bits needed for the page number

-offset is the index used to visit the words in these problems

A logical address space consisiting of 4 pages of 4096 words each and is mapped onto physical memory of 64 frames.

a)Logical addy space size? bits needed to address every word?
14 Bits, multiplying the 4 pages by 4096 words or doing 2^14 yields the words


b)Physical addy space size? bits needed to address every word?
2^16

1.air
2.water
3.sleep
4.food
5.shelter
6.connection
7.creative expression, 
express connections made

3.28.24
-1 way memory is protected if paging is used is by the mmu only allowing the process to access the pages by checking if the pages are valid

-how does mmu translate logical addy to physical addy
here's thenformula
mmu divides address by the page size yielding the page # and the remainder is the offset

Ex)
Just find the page # and offset given the addresses 
(translating the logical address to physical--> 5119, 5120, 33300)
LOGICAL ADDY   | 5119/512 = 9 remainder 0
PHYSICAL ADDY  |  4*512 +0 = 2048 +0

Degree of multiprogramming - # of processes executing AT A TIME, 
Demand paging - only loading the process when it is needed
Not memory resident - the page that has not been loaded yet

The MMU can also use the valid/invalid bit to know if the page is in memory (its set to 1 if yes)
After the mmu checks the valid/invalid bit and that its a memory resident the kernel then checks if that
process has the right

The process starts executing even tho the page is not

RANDOM NOTES
-The time to seek from one track to another depends on the # of tracks on the disk.
-Sector 0 IS THAT FIRST PART / Outermost cylinder...where we keep bootstrap stuff
-Track seeks from the outside to inward.

"THIS IS AN EXAM QUESTION"
A disk has 800 tracks per surface, 180 sectors per track, and 512 bytes per sector. The disk has 1 platter. The disk rotates 5000 rpm (roatation per minute). The seek time between adjacent tracks is 2ms.

1. Determine the total storage capacity of the disk 512 x 180 x 800 x 2(both sides)
2. Determine the num of seek operation to read the entire disk. Well, to visit the entire disk you would have to visit 800 tracks, one track to the next (ASSUMING ITS SEQUENTIAL SO OUTER TO INNERMOST TRACK ON DISK)
3. How much data in bytes each track has? 180 x 512 = 92k
4. How long 1 rotation takes? 1 min is 5000 r's so 1 rotation is how long? 1/5000 so 1ms i guess, (just use the conversion formula) nah it is 1/5000 0.125 seconds
5.How much time needed to visit all sectors of 1 track? 1 rotation
we want read write head to read data from all the sectors so we want 1 rotation
6.What is the transfer time of 1 sector?
0.067ms


other example involving the SCAN algo for disk retrieivng info
the r/w head is at tracj 30 and is moving up when requests for tracks 60,40,20,10 arrive
Under DCAN, tje total traval distance of the r/w head is ____ tracks.

first 30, we go 30 to 10, then go all the way to 0 then switch directions and service 40, service 60, 



The r/w head of a disk is at track 143 The previous position was track 9l 
Requests to access the following tracks have aarrived: 143, 86, 1470, 913, 1774, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 

In which order will the tracks be visited using: FIFO,SSTF,SCAN,LOOK


LOOK algo - looks ahead for the next process



FINAL EXAM ON 4/18/23 
TOPICS START FROM PAGING AND RANGE TO DISK(V-MEMORY, CRASHING,FILE SYSTEMS, DISKS)

-Random note ab disk: Shortest seek time first will wear out hardware fast because of the constant switching of disk's arm (all the disk algos: FIFO,SSTF,SCAN,LOOK)

homework explained
Assignment description :

Write a program in C to determine how many page faults will occur with a FIFO and LRU replacement policy(i think this is the zybooks addin and subbin #'s). 

You will read from the command line 2 parameters as shown below:

myprogram pagereffile numberofframes

The file will have an integer set of page references separated by spaces without any newlines of space at the end of the line. The number of page references is not limited. The numberofframes must be between 1 and 10. You will output the number of page faults and the final state of memory.

you can use the sample reference string used in class to verify the correctness of your program : 

7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 0 3 2 1 2 0 1 7 0 1
Sample output
./a.out myfile.txt 3
FIFO: 15 page faults
Final state of memory: 7 0 1 
LRU: 12 page faults
Final state of memory: 1 0 7 

4.16.24 
-Reading Zybooks: 1st start at PAGING, then continue on to V-MEMORY, CRASHING,FILE SYSTEMS, DISKS
*Note for DISKS the example from class is the correct one not what zybooks is teaching.
Write your own definition for each one

PAGING - 




/*
Process i

while (true){

flag[i] = true;

while (true){

flag[j] = true;
turn = i;
while (flag[i] && turn = = i)

The while loop of both processes(they runnin concurrently) makes sure that these proccesses arent running @ the same time. 
^the idea is rom the topic of critical sections / petersons solution

  ^^'once one thread or process has entered the critical section, all other threads 
  or processes must wait until the executing thread or process exits the critical section'

    1. Introduction -  Trade Diary ( the design is similar its 3 circles 
    on your screen top one is your trade[green or red], middle is the details section / notes[white]), last is stats based
    on your trade/similarities noticed -->(3rd losing trade this week have all been counter trend and held over 10mins)

           1.1 Purpose - For traders to gain insight by entering their trades and seeing their statistics based on the data.

           1.2 Intended Audience - Unprofitable traders & profitable traders alike (talkin bout the software not the SRS doc)

           1.3 Intended Use - As a journal of sorts to be written into daily from the user's mobile phone or laptop/PC via browser.

           1.4 Product Scope - We hope to expand to 100k users as the product is free until further notice, accessible via chrome, safari
           EDGE, and most browsers.
           1.5 Definitions and Acronyms - SL stop loss, TP take profit, HOD high of day, LOD of day, 0dte 0 day to expration, cons contracts etc.

2. Overall Description

           2.1 User Needs - The product will be used by primary users which are traders, swing/day traders who would like to track their trades using
           the web app and recieve analytics based on their entered trades which they can learn from and notice pattern or behaviors.

           2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies - We are assuming they are on a laptop/desktop computer with at least 2GB of RAM with browsers commonly used in 2024 
           installed on said computers, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave etc.



            3.1 Functional Requirements - Heres a rough list but proper user stories with weight will be on Jira, espcially with that dot chart thing that gets more red
            the older the user story gets.
            #1. The system must have a text box where users type text, save, and load their saved text upon logging in to the web app.

            3.2 External Interface Requirements

            3.3 System Features

            3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
            
  Planning phase- User stories
                  
   1.As a user I would like to see my trades on the main page of the app
   2.As a user I would like a text box to write text into under the trade details on the main page of the app.
   3.As a user I would like there to be stats showing me trends in my trades on the main page of the app.
   (Biggest losses on big news days, major losses during counter trend trades etc.)
   4.As a user I would like this to be saved for next time I use the app.

  4.4.24 No longer talkn bout Vmemory, Files
  abs-referencing starting with root
  relative-referencing within folder
  
  vocab
  reference count - # of pointers to file
  symbolic link - USED for when we wanna delete the file without errors since a bunch of other stuff is using that file
  ^(not an actual phsyical link so, deletes this not the file itself)

  fcb practice
  The create operation must specify the

  Avoid duplct file names, create op must search ___
  -The current directory

  The destroy operation must__
  -search directry for file name
  -free directry entry corresponding to the file
  -The WHOLE FCB is destroyed so no pointers to the disk block gotta be destroyed

  The file name is
  supplied as aparameter to the open operation

  The file length is extracted from the fcb


3. System Features and Requirements
  A file contains the 26 characters "a" through "z" the file is open with the oft index 3 the block size is 16 bytes
  the following operations are issued
  1.read 3, m, 1
  2. read 3, m, 24
  3. read 3,m, 1
  operation explained:
  read 3m n 1
  read reads
  3 from index 3 in memory
  m from read and write before from memory lcoation called m
  1 is the size of how many bytes being read so you wanna read 1 byte
  
  After op 3 the 1st byte of the memory area m will contain the character z
  The final character as we see #1,#2 1 and 24 combine to 25, taking up 25 of 26 characters mentioned above in the problem.

till 6, write below all the possible deadlines for stuff: also delegate hrs for CodePath, T-Journal Project, HW, Backtesting

6.16.24
---------------------------------
1hr allocated to G1,G1.5,G2
priority list based on deadlines:

G2-canvas hw(discussion on lexical analysis, DUE TOMORROW) 
-thats the only real recent deadline but I would like to nominate:

G1-Backtesting jimmy strat + rp profits start with emphasis on strictly predetermining exact entries,exits, and sl
(eadlines: market open tomorrow so i'd like to get to it today)

G1.5-Apply to at least 1 ship', but also use the hour to go and catch up with the leetcode stuff

Those are what I chose for this new 3 hour a day system, here's the miscellaneous list:
-begin day 1 of learnin jp thru cm 
-continue dev of journaling web app
-t

**NOTE-DELAY: G2 delayed the rest as TRYING to understand the hw is takin some time(readin chp 4, checkin chegg, making response. Each of which is approx an hour)**

-6/16 Update: the answers ready just gotta translate it over to a canva diagram and find out how the other thing(compare diagram chart & diagram list) relates to it.

-2nd Update: Apllied to 'ship, feels like we're working on small bits of different tasks back and forth instead of allocating strictly 1hr of good focus to each.
-3rd Update: Non negotiables -->Backtesting today at least oncce. & Organizing that journal for general stuff.
