  That api key stuff being hidden is whats causing this page 
  to not run after npm start

  11.17.23
  -CEN stuff:
  1. routing to the profile and about
  2. waiting on last minute changes from sum1
  3. $$$?

  11.19.23

  for presentation. 
  2.complete finishing touches to site 
  3.implement mp4's to site's dashboard?

  from the trades. focus on setting up the bare .20 move

  12.20.23
  -backtest open from days missed
  **-for jp get da days(call tmrw + mssg snt)
  -follow that yt vid on dev work where it suggests to build and then deploy a program
   my 1st thought was to make a more accessible/free version of tradezella as it is essentially
   a planner but with api's from ppl's brokers. scale it as much as possible via tt marketing
  -

  1.1.24
  -jp trip done
  -check the 3 classes to see if theres a syllabus on Goog...
  check em', if textbooks required write it here,
  if more than 1 textbook is needed than get the bookpack
  else if its 1 textbook dont get the bookpack.


  
  cop4610 op sys taught by KBA (IN PERSON) (Tue. & Thur. 12:30pm-1:45pm) @ 105 in PG6
  ^syllbus not online must wait it out till 6th or sumn

  ^syllbus not online must wait it out till 6th or sumn

  consensus: due to 2 of 3 being online i decline the panthr bookpack

  1.6.24
  -goalpost set: reverse engineer
  1.7.24
  -start with login page into dashboard, find best tool to use for this keeping in mind that
  we are deploying it for real users and need security stuff and what not.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Project Idea: *WebApp* TradeZella but Free,  (goal is to get a whole lotta users not 2 customers)
  
  Phases of development to follow https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-development-life-cycle/
  Use the Weighted scoring for the features, for example, since we want to track the user's trades
  the highest weighted features/non-negotiables would be of course showing the user's trades neatly and 
  letting them type AND showing stats/trends in their behavior. Those 3 are necessary
  (trade's info being type of contract, time spent in the trade, profit, etc.)

  All thats left is G2 due tomorrow for the zybooks challenge activities for operating systems.

  1.25.24
  os principles: slides from chp.4
  -

  1.27.24
  -next zybooks and commence the 2 db classes:
  -where does zybooks start? 
  This one starts at 3.2 with the challenge activities and ends at 3.3 as 3.5 is due on 2/5/24 for some reason
  -Before EOD try to get these out the way to begin some db work. 
  -The challenge activity is lierally the class exercise where we had learned FCFS to order the processes (P1,P2,P3)
  -ETA on how long to finish these 2 zybooks is like 3 hours prob + 30 min to start the assignment 1 or at least get the envrnment set up
  1.28.24
  -same biz but finishin it
  
  1.30.24
  -O.S. Principles: the programming assignment is due saturday, its using the fork function to do math stuff
  and aside from the .c file with the code we need a brief report explaining the design choices and the lessons
  learned during the implementation.

  This program is a simulation of parallel task execution-process forking makes
  n number of child processes performing unique jobs, while te parent process will
  wait for these child processes to finish before displaying a final result.


//Luis Chavez, 6119616

2.3.24 ez will finish in this last fateful hour
2.4.24 found out the zybooks is just a single one and finish the CTS work
2.5.24 zybook 3 legit


2.6.24 - more exam info
0.Round robin and those type of scheduling questions so just do ZyBooks, avg turn around times - only gotta provide the 
final equation cuz we dont need calculators ------fcfs is not on exam, but the zybooks 3 stuff will b there too (ONLY DRAWIN GANTT CHART) for those---------
1.Alrdy noted above, but test has definitions to be matched by o.s. vocab
2.Privelged instructions - review them to answer comprehendsion/scenario questions (writtten)
3.Multiple choice questions - Processes, threads, kernel, scheduling algos, diff processes states(the ready->suspended bs),
parallelism, no c programming being written BUT there will be a c program with fork system call to be questioned upon. 
Understanding that the child is a copy of the parent.
Real time scheduling algo as well.
4.no calculation on waiting time and such

SJF canvas example, Non-preemptive
Turn around time = compltion time - arrival time 
when doing the gant chart, its always arrival time = 0 first and then, 
ordered by the shortest total cpu time 

RoundRobin scheduling mistake: not keeping track of the ready queue.


2/6/24 - one of the db class, its all zybooks

zybooks 3.2.4 sjf example refresh

PROGRMNG ASSIGNMNT 2 FOR OS
User inputs the # of processes along with burst time & arrival time for each process.
in addition to the desired scheduling algorithm.  this all comes from a txt file so the 
program will read that file.

file descriptor, so since we want to access stuff from this file theres the concept of 
the file descriptor and so the 'FILE *file' makes a pointer to the file and then file
funcs that start with f like f gets, file = fopen(argv[1], "r") gere ra means read also
we open the file, then we scan the file with fscan(file, %d, num_process)
when done gotta put fclose(file)


process arrvl time  total cpu time/burst time?(is it same)
p1      0            6 
p2      1            1
p3      2            4

Round Robin algo, 1.we got a queue 2.priority is based on position of that queue 
3.this highest priority process then can run for Q time units(time quantum), q ends
& the process is moved to the end of the queue.
ex:
process arrvl-time  total cpu time/burst time?(is it same)
p1      n/a            4 
p2      n/a            4
p3      n/a            2

so the q is 1 here there will be blocks on the gant chart only of size 1 until it meets
the total cpu time


2.7.24
-zybooks based on above
2.9.24 - zybooks but for db class, small futures scalp

2.11.24 - complete journal, complete g2 work for PA2
  //next assignment will be able to present stuff 

2.11.24
-zybooks for cop4751, data strge & beyond

    1. Introduction -  Trade Diary ( the design is similar its 3 circles 
    on your screen top one is your trade[green or red], middle is the details section / notes[white]), last is stats based
    on your trade/similarities noticed -->(3rd losing trade this week have all been counter trend and held over 10mins)

           1.1 Purpose - For traders to gain insight by entering their trades and seeing their statistics based on the data.

           1.2 Intended Audience - Unprofitable traders & profitable traders alike (talkin bout the software not the SRS doc)

           1.3 Intended Use - As a journal of sorts to be written into daily from the user's mobile phone or laptop/PC via browser.

           1.4 Product Scope - We hope to expand to 100k users as the product is free until further notice, accessible via chrome, safari
           EDGE, and most browsers.

           1.5 Definitions and Acronyms - SL stop loss, TP take profit, HOD high of day, LOD of day, 0dte 0 day to expration, cons contracts etc.

2. Overall Description

           2.1 User Needs - The product will be used by primary users which are traders, swing/day traders who would like to track their trades using
           the web app and recieve analytics based on their entered trades which they can learn from and notice pattern or behaviors.

           2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies - We are assuming they are on a laptop/desktop computer with at least 2GB of RAM with browsers commonly used in 2024 
           installed on said computers, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave etc.

3. System Features and Requirements

            3.1 Functional Requirements - Heres a rough list but proper user stories with weight will be on Jira, espcially with that dot chart thing that gets more red
            the older the user story gets.
            #1. The system must have a text box where users type text, save, and load their saved text upon logging in to the web app.

            3.2 External Interface Requirements

            3.3 System Features

            3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
            
  Planning phase- User stories
                  
   1.As a user I would like to see my trades on the main page of the app
   2.As a user I would like a text box to write text into under the trade details on the main page of the app.
   3.As a user I would like there to be stats showing me trends in my trades on the main page of the app.
   (Biggest losses on big news days, major losses during counter trend trades etc.)
   4.As a user I would like this to be saved for next time I use the app.
